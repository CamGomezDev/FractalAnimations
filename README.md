# FractalAnimations
This project contains different fractals animations built in Processing. To run them you just have to open Processing and then open whatever folder you want to see that specific fractal. All fractals are independent of one another, so each one is its own Processing project.

These fractals were made for this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/ClHILRZ4Wk8

You can download Processing from here: https://processing.org/

And most of this project was based on this book chapter: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/

Most of the code in here isn't commented. I'm hoping that the variable names are descriptive enough, but if they aren't you can always open an issue and ask for help (in Spanish or English).
